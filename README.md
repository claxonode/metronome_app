# Metronome App

# Info
This is a metronome app, built with Expo, React-Native.

# Platforms
This is built for Android, and I have yet to do this on Apple.

# Features
- You can control the volume within the app without it affecting other apps, YouTube for example.
- You can control the tempo of the metronome.
- This app can play in the background which means that it can be used while multitasking.
